Pionic - PI-based Networked Instrument Controller

Physical configuration:

    The network interface connects to the factory subnet and receives an
    address via DHCP. The DHCP server is configured to assign a specific IP
    address for the PI's MAC, presumably correlates to the test station ID.

    A USB ethernet dongle attaches to the DUT and gets a static IP (defined in the Makefile
    pionic.cfg).

    The 40-pin I/O connector attaches to test instrumentation, which is
    customized for the specific test station requires and not in scope of this
    document.

    An "official" 7-inch touchscreen (attaches to the RPi display connector,
    NOT to HDMI).

Pionic provides:

    DNS proxy, and resolves 'pioinc.server', returning its own LAN address.

    NAT translation from the DUT to the factory server. Port 61080 is forwarded
    to factory server port 80, and 61443 is forwarded to factory server port
    443.

    If enabled, the beacon server is started on the DUT interface, this
    transmits "beacon ethernet packets. The DUT listens for beacons during
    boot, if detected then it enters factory diagnostic mode and brings up
    pre-defined static IP in the same subnet.

    Alternatively if the DUT will automatically bring up static IP during boot,
    it can simply attempt to access the factory server via port 61080, if the
    expected response is received then it enters diagnostic mode.

    Access to test-specific CGI's on port 80, the DUT uses curl e.g.:

        curl -f http://pionic.server/test

    User interface via the touchscreen display.

    Customizable test fixture support.

To install:

    Download the SDcard image:

        wget https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2019-06-24/2019-06-20-raspbian-buster-lite.zip

    Unzip and extract file 2019-06-20-raspbin-buster-lite.img (about 1.8GB).

    Copy the img file to an 8GB SDcard using dd on linux or Win32DiskImager
    on Windows.

    Insert the card into the RPi, attach display or monitor and usb keyboard,
    attach ethernet. It should boot to a text console (if it boots to X, you
    have the wrong image).  Log in as user 'pi', password 'raspberry'

    Run:
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade
        sudo reboot

    Log back in and:

        sudo apt install git
        git clone https://github.com/glitchub/pionic
        cd pionic

    Review pionic.cfg and make desired changes, then:

        make

    Assuming install is completed normally, just esure that a USB dongle is
    attached and reboot. The Pi will boot and run the script pionic.sh.

    pionic.sh waits for networking to be up, then reqests a fixture driver name
    from the server. If no name is provided then it uses 'default'.

    If the named driver directory does exist in the './fixtures', then
    pionic.sh will download fixtgures.tar.gz from the server, unpack it to a
    temp directory, and look for the fixture directory there.

    The fixture directory will contain script fixture.sh, pionic calls that
    script and does not exit it to return.

    Note it is possible to install pionic in 'local' mode by setting
    "SERVER_IP=" without a value. It will not attempt to talk to the server and
    will start the 'local' fixture driver, i.e. ./fixtures/local/fixture.sh.
    Currently the local driver just starts a cgi server that supports the mkfm
    command option.
